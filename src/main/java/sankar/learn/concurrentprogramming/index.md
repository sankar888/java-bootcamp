### Threads in Java
Threads are independent paths of execution through an applicationâ€™s code. Each Java application has a default main thread that executes the main() method.
The Java virtual machine (JVM) gives each thread its own JVM stack to prevent threads from interfering with each other

Java supports threads primarily through its <code>java.lang.Thread</code> class and <code>java.lang.Runnable</code> interface

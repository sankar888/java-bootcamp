/**
 * See: https://www.cpp.edu/~ftang/courses/CS241/notes/heap.htm
 * A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfied the heap property:
 * if B is a child node of A, then key(A) â‰¥ key(B). This implies that an element with the greatest key is always in the root node,
 * and so such a heap is sometimes called a max-heap.
 * There's also a min-heap, in which the root node is the minimum element
 *
 * Heap has many variants
 * 2-3 heap
 * Binary heap
 * Many many others
 *
 * Binary heap is a common data structure which is used to order elements by priority. A binary heap has only two children
 */
public class BinaryMaxHeap<E extends Comparable> {
    /**
     * All nodes in Binary heap should have a max of two children.
     * Heap is also a complete binary tree, which means the new elements are inserted in a way that the level is always complete before moving to next level
     * The new elements are inserted at the left most open position on the last level of the tree.
     *
     * The most common implementation of Heap is using an array.
     * [a , lc(a), rc(a), lc(lc(a)), rc(lc(a)), lc(rc(a)), rc(rc(A)), ...]
     * lc(a) -> left child of a
     * rc(a) -> right child of a
     * lc(lc(a)) -> left child of left child of a, this element is at 2nd level, if we consider root as 0th level
     *
     * Arranging the elements as above,
     * if i is the index if element a, then the index of left and right child of a is
     * index(lc(a)) = 2i + 1
     * index(rc(a)) = 2i + 2
     *
     * In java, array is a constant length data structure, what happens if the size of binary heap overcomes the size of the array
     * We create a new array with double the size of the current array and copy the elements to the new array. (same as logic used in arraylist)

    /**
     * Common Operations involved in Heap
     * Basic
     *     find-max (or find-min): find a maximum item of a max-heap, or a minimum item of a min-heap, respectively (a.k.a. peek)
     *     insert: adding a new key to the heap (a.k.a., push[4])
     *     extract-max (or extract-min): returns the node of maximum value from a max heap [or minimum value from a min heap] after removing it from the heap (a.k.a., pop[5])
     *     delete-max (or delete-min): removing the root node of a max heap (or min heap), respectively
     *     replace: pop root and push a new key. More efficient than pop followed by push, since only need to balance once, not twice, and appropriate for fixed-size heaps.[6]
     *
     * Creation
     *     create-heap: create an empty heap
     *     heapify: create a heap out of given array of elements
     *     merge (union): joining two heaps to form a valid new heap containing all the elements of both, preserving the original heaps.
     *     meld: joining two heaps to form a valid new heap containing all the elements of both, destroying the original heaps.
     *
     * Inspection
     *     size: return the number of items in the heap.
     *     is-empty: return true if the heap is empty, false otherwise.
     *
     * Internal
     *     increase-key or decrease-key: updating a key within a max- or min-heap, respectively
     *     delete: delete an arbitrary node (followed by moving last node and sifting to maintain heap)
     *     sift-up: move a node up in the tree, as long as needed; used to restore heap condition after insertion. Called "sift" because node moves up the tree until it reaches the correct level, as in a sieve.
     *     sift-down: move a node down in the tree, similar to sift-up; used to restore heap condition after deletion or replacement.

### Java Programming Language
java is a high level programming language which is characterized by the following buzzwords

- Simple
- Object oriented
- Distributed
- Multithreaded
- Dynamic
- Architecture neutral
- Portable
- High performance
- Robust
- Secure

The above keywords can be explained in detail in [The java language whitepaper](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/langenv-140151.html)

Java programs are written in plain *.java* file and compiled to *.class* files by **javac** compiler.
The compiled .class files are run using *java* command, which launches a java virtual machine which runs the compiled bytecode. 
The compiled .class files has *bytecode* which is not native to the os but understood by the *java virtual machine*. 
The java virtual machine (JVM) then transfers the bytecode to platform dependent instructions. JVM is platform dependent. 

#### The java platform
The java platform is java virtual machine and java API. The java API is a set of basic libraries provided by java language for common tasks.

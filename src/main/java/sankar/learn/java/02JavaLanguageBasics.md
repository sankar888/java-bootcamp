### Java language Basics

#### Object-Oriented Programming
Object-oriented programming ia style of programming which models a program on the basis of interaction within objects.

What Is an Object?

Software objects are conceptually similar to real-world objects: they too consist of state and related behavior. 
An object stores its state in fields (variables in some programming languages) and exposes its behavior through methods (functions in some programming languages).
Methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication.
Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods is known as data encapsulation â€” a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming

What Is a Class?

A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. 

What Is Inheritance?

Inheritance provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring your software.
Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes. 
In this example, Bicycle now becomes the superclass of MountainBike, RoadBike, and TandemBike. 
In the Java programming language, each class is allowed to have one direct superclass, 
and each superclass has the potential for an unlimited number of subclasses:

What Is an Interface?

An interface is a contract between a class and the outside world. 
When a class implements an interface, it promises to provide the behavior published by that interface.

What Is a Package?

A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in logical manner. Conceptually you can think of packages as being similar to different folders on your computer. 
Placing your code into packages makes large software projects easier to manage.
